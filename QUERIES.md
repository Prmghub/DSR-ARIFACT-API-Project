## ðŸ“Š EF Querying Strategies for DSR Artifact Management

This section outlines various Entity Framework (EF) querying strategies and examples that are critical for the efficient management and querying of the Design Science Research (DSR) artifacts database schema. These examples demonstrate how to utilize EF to interact with the database, ensuring efficiency, performance, and data integrity.

### Eager Loading for Related Data
Eager loading is essential for loading related data alongside the main entity. This approach minimizes the number of database calls, improving performance when accessing related data is necessary.

```csharp
var artifactsWithDetails = dbContext.Artifacts
    .Include(a => a.ContextMotivation)
    .Include(a => a.ArtifactDescription)
    .Include(a => a.ArtifactFeedback)
    .Where(a => a.Author.Contains("Author Name"))
    .ToList();
```

### Filtered Includes
EF Core 5.0 introduced the ability to apply filters directly within the `Include` method, allowing for more precise data retrieval.

```csharp
var artifacts = dbContext.Artifacts
    .Include(a => a.ArtifactFeedback.Where(f => f.DateReceived > DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30)))
    .ToList();
```

### Projection Queries
Projection queries transform the results of a query into a different shape. This can be a powerful tool for improving performance by selecting only the necessary data.

```csharp
var artifactSummaries = dbContext.Artifacts
    .Select(a => new ArtifactSummaryDto
    {
        Title = a.Title,
        Author = a.Author,
        CreationDate = a.CreationDate,
        FeedbackCount = a.ArtifactFeedback.Count
    })
    .ToList();
```

### AsNoTracking for Read-Only Scenarios
`AsNoTracking` is recommended for read-only scenarios where tracking changes is not required. It can significantly improve query performance.

```csharp
var readOnlyArtifacts = dbContext.Artifacts
    .AsNoTracking()
    .Where(a => a.Keywords.Contains("research"))
    .ToList();
```

### Utilizing Raw SQL for Complex Queries
For complex queries that are difficult to express or optimize in LINQ, dropping down to raw SQL might be the best approach.

```csharp
var artifacts = dbContext.Artifacts
    .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Artifacts WHERE Keywords LIKE '%innovative%'")
    .ToList();
```

### Batch Operations
Batch operations can significantly reduce the number of database round-trips by combining multiple operations into a single call.

```csharp
// Requires EF Extensions or EF Core Plus
dbContext.Artifacts
    .Where(a => a.CreationDate < DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(-1))
    .Update(a => new Artifact { Status = "Archived" });
```

### Advanced Queries
Below are additional examples of queries that showcase searching, retrieving detailed information, and tracking changes and feedback within the DSR artifact lifecycle.

```csharp
// Advanced Query Examples:

// 1. Joining Multiple Tables to Aggregate Data
// This query demonstrates how to join multiple related tables to aggregate and summarize data, such as summarizing feedback for each artifact.
var artifactFeedbackSummary = dbContext.Artifacts
    .GroupJoin(dbContext.ArtifactFeedback,
        artifact => artifact.ArtifactID,
        feedback => feedback.ArtifactID,
        (artifact, feedbacks) => new
        {
            ArtifactTitle = artifact.Title,
            FeedbackCount = feedbacks.Count(),
            AverageFeedbackScore = feedbacks.Average(f => f.Score) // Assuming there's a Score column
        })
    .ToList();

// 2. Complex Filtering with Sub-Queries
// Filtering artifacts based on criteria that require sub-queries, such as artifacts with more than X feedback entries in the last month.
var artifactsWithActiveFeedback = dbContext.Artifacts
    .Where(artifact => dbContext.ArtifactFeedback
        .Count(feedback => feedback.ArtifactID == artifact.ArtifactID && feedback.DateReceived > DateTime.UtcNow.AddMonths(-1)) > 5)
    .ToList();

// 3. Conditional Aggregation
// Aggregating data conditionally within a group, such as counting feedback types or categories for each artifact.
var artifactFeedbackTypes = dbContext.Artifacts
    .Select(artifact => new
    {
        ArtifactTitle = artifact.Title,
        PositiveFeedbackCount = dbContext.ArtifactFeedback
            .Count(feedback => feedback.ArtifactID == artifact.ArtifactID && feedback.Type == "Positive"),
        NegativeFeedbackCount = dbContext.ArtifactFeedback
            .Count(feedback => feedback.ArtifactID == artifact.ArtifactID && feedback.Type == "Negative")
    })
    .ToList();

// 4. Using Raw SQL for Highly Customized Queries
// When LINQ queries are not sufficient or optimal for very complex queries, raw SQL can be used.
var customQueryResult = dbContext.Artifacts
    .FromSqlRaw("SELECT ArtifactID, COUNT(*) as FeedbackCount FROM ArtifactFeedback GROUP BY ArtifactID HAVING COUNT(*) > 10")
    .ToList();

// 5. Dynamic Query Building
// Building queries dynamically based on runtime conditions, useful for creating flexible search interfaces.
var query = dbContext.Artifacts.AsQueryable();
if (someCondition)
{
    query = query.Where(a => a.CreationDate > DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(-1));
}
if (anotherCondition)
{
    query = query.Include(a => a.ArtifactFeedback).Where(a => a.ArtifactFeedback.Any(f => f.Score > 4));
}
var dynamicResults = query.ToList();
```

Leveraging these querying strategies within the Entity Framework allows for sophisticated data management practices that are both performant and maintainable. This foundation will enable us to build a responsive and data-rich application for managing DSR artifacts.
