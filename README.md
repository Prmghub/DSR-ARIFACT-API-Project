# Design Science Research (DSR) Artifact Management System

Welcome to the DSR Artifact Management System, a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate the management, analysis, and tracking of artifacts in Design Science Research. Built with ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and React, this project aims to create an intuitive and robust platform for researchers and developers.

## 🌟 Features

- **Artifact Lifecycle Management**: Track the creation, development, and feedback stages of research artifacts.
- **Collaborative Research Platform**: Enable collaboration among researchers through shared access to artifacts.
- **Insightful Analytics**: Analyze the impact and progression of artifacts through detailed reports and dashboards.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilize a React-based frontend for dynamic interaction with the artifact database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up the DSR Artifact Management System on your local machine:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK, Node.js, and a suitable SQL Server instance installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Prmghub/DSR-ARIFACT-API-Project.git
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Backend: `cd DSR-ARIFACT-API-Project && dotnet restore`
   - Frontend: `cd ClientApp && npm install`
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Backend: `dotnet run`
   - Frontend: `npm start`

## 📚 Documentation
