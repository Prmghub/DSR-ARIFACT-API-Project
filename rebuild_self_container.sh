# Cloned Codex Container

This container attempts to replicate the environment in which Codex is currently running.

It includes:
- Kernel and OS info
- Environment variables
- A template Dockerfile based on Ubuntu 24.04

This can be used as a base image for installing additional runtimes like .NET SDK in isolation.

To build it:
\`\`\`bash
cd cloned-container
docker build -t codex-clone .
\`\`\`
